The test directory has these files:

- small.csv

  I worked several examples out by hand using this small 2x3 table.

- small.gmpl

  This file expresses the linear programming problem used to approximate an optimal solution
using the GNU MathProg modeling language.
This can be run in various online solvers
and allows for a comparison with the results produced by the main program.

- ramen-ratings.csv

  This dataset was taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/ramen-ratings)
and is copyright Aleksey Bilogur.
This is a medium-large example file (2581 rows, 7 columns) with plain text content.

- ramen-ratings-30.csv

  A smaller test set, only the first 30 entries from the ramen-ratings.csv dataset.
